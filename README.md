## üõ†Ô∏è Paper Abstract

Whole-body multimodal motion generation, controlled by text, speech, or music, has numerous applications including video generation and character animation. However, employing a unified model to achieve various generation tasks with different condition modalities presents two main challenges: motion distribution drifts across different tasks (e.g., co-speech gestures and text-driven daily actions) and the complex optimization of mixed conditions with varying granularities (e.g., text and audio). Additionally, inconsistent motion formats across different tasks and datasets hinder effective training toward multimodal motion generation. In this paper, we propose MotionCraft, a unified diffusion transformer that crafts whole-body motion with plug-and-play multimodal control. Our framework employs a coarse-to-fine training strategy, starting with the first stage of text-to-motion semantic pre-training, followed by the second stage of multimodal low-level control adaptation to handle conditions of varying granularities. To effectively learn and transfer motion knowledge across different distributions, we design MC-Attn for parallel modeling of static and dynamic human topology graphs. To overcome the motion format inconsistency of existing benchmarks, we introduce MC-Bench, the first available multimodal whole-body motion generation benchmark based on the unified SMPL-X format. Extensive experiments show that MotionCraft achieves state-of-the-art performance on various standard motion generation tasks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Environment Requirement üåç

MotionCraft has been implemented and tested on Pytorch 1.12.1 with python 3.9.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/cure-lab/MotionCraft.git
```

We recommend you first use `conda` to create virtual environment, and install `pytorch` following [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/). For example:


```
conda create -n motioncraft python=3.9 -y
conda activate motioncraft
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -y
```

Then, you can install mmcv with:

```
pip install "mmcv-full>=1.4.2,<=1.9.0"
```

After that, you can install required packages thourgh:

```
cd MotionCraft
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Noted: *Due to dataset license limitation, we can not redistribute the processed MC-Bench here. However, we provide detailed steps to construct from the original data sources.*

<details> <summary> Text-to-Motion Benchmark Construction </summary>

* Following the processing workflow of Mocap Datasets in [MotionX](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Motion-X/tree/main/mocap-dataset-process), obtain a processed subset of SMPL-X HumanML3D from the raw AMASS dataset.
* Follow [the official preparation](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/text-to-motion/blob/f8eecd27341b04464e363f0acd993cabef52b1ce/data/dataset.py#L69) to align each motion data with different text annotations and different time intervals by running the following code:
  ```
  cd ./data/datasets/motionx
  mkdir motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml3d_align_test
  mkdir motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml3d_align_train_val
  mkdir motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml3d_align_test
  mkdir motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml3d_align_train_val

  python humanml3d_clip_align.py

  rm -rf motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml
  rm -rf motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml

  mv motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml3d_align_test/* motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml3d_align_train_val/
  mv motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml3d_align_test/* motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml3d_align_train_val/
  rm -rf motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml3d_align_test
  rm -rf motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml3d_align_test

  mv motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml3d_align_train_val motionx/motion_data/smplx_322/humanml
  mv motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml3d_align_train_val motionx/texts/semantic_labels/humanml

  ```

  Noted: *As described in our paper, our base model has two variants: MotionCraft-Basic and MotionCraft-Mix. MotionCraft-Basic refers to the model where the first stage is trained only on the HumanML3D subset of MC-Bench, while MotionCraft-Mix refers to the model where the first stage is trained on all subsets of MC-Bench (HumanML3D, BEAT2, FineDance). The text processing components for the latter two are included in the Speech-to-Motion Benchmark Construction and Music-to-Dance Benchmark Construction.*
